* What is the population of interest?
* Importantly, the optimal design depends on the question that you would like to address!
  * Example: take care to include the right type of controls. When comparing groups, any differences between them will be picked up, whether they are caused by biology, technical/protocol differences or batch effects.
* Experimental design is intimately related to what you actually want to get out of your experiment.

ENCODE consortium, set out to address a difficult question
Results were a bit surprising, but argued that previous studies had been biased by using a small set of tissues, and focusing on tissue-specific genes etc.
"Overall, our results indicate that there is considerable RNA expression diversity between humans and mice, well beyond what was described previously, likely reflecting the fundamental physiological differences between these two organisms."

Went into fastq files to extract info about sequencer, flow cell, lane
None of the possible confounders were reported in the paper
According to the authors, "22 of the libraries were constructed in a single batch and sequenced on four lanes"

# Follow-up experiments triggered

* Resequencing of a subset of the tissue samples with a non-confounded sequencing design - similar conclusions.
  * Doesn't address the underlying sample differences

* Analysis of Fantom5 CAGE data (matched human and mouse) - same conclusions.

* Analysis of GTEx tissue samples
  * "Neither sex nor age contributed to the clustering in the first two principal components. Thus, these effects are likely to be small and have not been included in the studies of others as well."

The second set did not include ovary (exhausted material), different model sequencing instruments were used, and the reagents from the supplier were different. Also, the RNA may have changed over the two years since their extraction from tissue, especially for spleen and pancreas.

.pull-right[
- .large[Batch effect adjustment effectively "equalizes" or "aligns" the different batches.]
- .large[By construction, this removes systematic shift between different sequencing runs.]
- .large[**Unavoidably**, this removes also of the species effect (the species are sequenced in different batches).]
- .large[There's _no way_ to determine the source of the signal based on this data alone.]

]

???
Global normalization is not enough - batch effects are gene-specific. 
This is an annoying place to be - we've spent all the money collecting the data, and we can't say anything. Maybe the conclusions were right, maybe not. We'll need to collect more data to figure out what's happening and estimate the size of any confounding effect separately, and try to impose that on the original experiment.

* After batch correction, the subtypes represent the strongest signal in the data.
* This was **only** possible since the subtypes were spread randomly across the analysis batches!
* This illustrates that it's not (mainly) the presence of batch effects _per se_, but the confounding with the signal of interest, that causes problems for the analysis.

# How do we 'adjust for' batch effects in statistical modeling?
    
* .large[In statistical modeling (e.g., differential expression analysis), batch effects can be included as covariates (additional predictors) in the model.]

$$y = \beta_0 + \beta_1\cdot batch + \beta_2\cdot condition + \varepsilon$$

* .large[Note that if ] $batch$ .large[ and ] $condition$ .large[ coincide, we can at best hope to estimate ] $\beta_1 + \beta_2$.
--

* .large[For exploratory analysis, we often attempt to "eliminate" or "adjust for" such unwanted variation in advance, by subtracting the estimated effect from each variable (e.g. the expression of a gene).]
  * .large[Not recommended before statistical modelling, since the variance will be underestimated.]

--
* .large[Even partial confounding between batch and signal of interest can lead to problems.]

We can't change the fact that these factors impact the measurements, we just need to design the experiment so that we can still say something about what we want
 (we'll talk about randomization and blocking later)

# Always beware of confounding

.Large[
* Careful design is always important - beware of confounding e.g. in situations where we
  * have to split a large data set into multiple analysis batches
  * use a control group from another (public) data set
  * use different reagent batches
  * collect an expanding data set (adding one condition at a time)
  * work in collaborative projects, where each center generates a subset of the data
  * change some aspect of the sample/library preparation protocol
  * work on an instrument with a drift/degradation over time
  * work with samples that degrade over time
  * ...

# So why should we care about experimental design? 

.pull-left[
.Large[
* Improved reproducibility of results
* Improved validity and generalizability of conclusions
* Efficient and ethical use of resources
  * Make sure that the design is adequate for answering the question of interest
  * Avoid having to repeat poorly designed experiments
  * Avoid spending resources on non-interpretable experiments

# Different types of experiments

.pull-left[

* **Learning** experiments
  * Discover as much as possible about a condition/situation/phenomenon, generate new hypotheses.
  * Example: "Does stress affect rodent behaviour?"
  * Heterogenous subjects and environment.
  * Several treatments/time points.
]]

.pull-right[
.full-width[.content-box-green[
* **Confirming** experiments
  * Verify/validate an observation (typically from a learning experiment or literature).
  * Example: "Does fox urine odour affect the amount of food Wistar rats consume during the first 24 hours after exposure?"
  * Standardized subjects and environment.
  * Small number of treatments/time points.
]]
]

* Both types of experiments are valuable.
* Most high-throughput experiments today are learning experiments.
* Beware of learning experiments that are _presented_ as confirming experiments.
  * Example: many protocols are tested, only the results from the "best" one are shown.
* Data from a learning experiment should not be reused in a follow-up confirming experiment.

* Most of the time, our goal is to estimate treatment effects as well as possible. 
* (Technical) factors that are not of direct interest are often collectively referred to as 'batch effects'.
* We (typically) can't do much about the fact that all these factors _have_ an effect on our measurements.
* What we can (and should) do is to design our experiments in such a way that the impact on our ability to draw conclusions is minimized.
